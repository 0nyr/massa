## Install tools

First, install general tools for `node` dev:

1. Install `nvm` [(NVM | GitHub)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Use `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash` to do so. Don't forget to open a new terminal after or run `source ~/.bashrc` to make the new command available.
2. Use `nvm install node` to install the latest version of `node`. Or use `nvm install --lts` to install the latest LTS of `node`.
3. `npm i yarn -g`: install `yarn` (package manager similar to `npm` but more recent). No need to install manually `npx` since it comes with `npm`.

Once the necessary tooling have been installed, install MASSA specific libs. We will use `yarn` instead of `npm`:

1. `yarn add @as-pect/cli massa-sc-std massa-sc-scripts --dev`
2.
